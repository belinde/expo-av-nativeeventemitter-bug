== Minimal reproducible example for a expo-av bug report

As long the App is loaded, a couple of warings appears:

```
 WARN  `new NativeEventEmitter()` was called with a non-null argument without the required `addListener` method.
 WARN  `new NativeEventEmitter()` was called with a non-null argument without the required `removeListeners` method.
```

Whenever the Sound is played, another couple of the same warnings is displayed
